    "###### Assignment 2 - Interplanetary Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will use a Lambert targeter to generate a first guess for an unperturbed interplanetary transfer. Subsequently, you will use various numerical propagation models that include perturbations to analyze the trajectory in more detail, and compute trajectory corrections such that your trajectory meets its boundary conditions (departure and arrival) in the perturbed environment,\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are required to modify this Jupyter notebook. Unlike assignment 1, this assignment is in a single notebook, with the code for all questions and the assignment description all merged into a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use a so-called Lambert targeter (a tool that solves Lambert's problem) to generate an initial guess for an interplanetary direct high-thrust transfer. The Lambert targeter takes as input:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>A departure position $\\mathbf{r}_0$</li>\n",
    "    <li>An arrival position $\\mathbf{r}_E$</li>\n",
    "    <li>A time of flight $T$</li>\n",
    "    <li>A central body gravitational parameter $\\mu$</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lambert targeter then generates the Keplerian trajectory between $\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{E}$, with the given time of flight $T$. Since the initial and final positions uniquely define the trajectory (assuming a prograde single-revolution trajectory; ignoring rare singular cases), the full state along this Keplerian trajectory (or Lambert arc) are *outputs* of the Lambert targeter. We denote the Cartesian state function of this Lambert arc as $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t)$. For your situation, the initial and final position $\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{E}$ of the full trajectory are the positions of the center of mass of Earth and Mars or Venus (w.r.t. the Sun), at times $t_{0}$ and $t_{E}$, respectively (with values depending on your student number, to be found in the $\\texttt{assignment2Input-2020-2021.txt}$ file on Brightspace under Assignment 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "All analysis on the output data can be done in the notebook. However, if you would like to use a different piece of software (*e.g.* Matlab) for your analyses, the relevant data is provided as output to data files, in a number of manners:\n",
    "\n",
    "* By calling the `propagate_trajectory` function, the propagated state of the spacecraft and the associated dependent variables will be saved to a file, as well as the state of the Lambert arc $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}$ at the epochs of the numerical integration. See the in-code comments of the `write_propagation_results_to_file` function in the helper functions block code file for more details.\n",
    "* For question 3, the `write_propagation_results_to_file` function is called directly from the $\\texttt{main}$ function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before starting the assignment, read the submission instructions given at the end of this notebook.**\n",

    "We will now turn our attention to modifying the trajectory, so that we arrive at the desired target when *including* perturbations. When we modify an initial state $\\mathbf{x}_{0}$ or some parameter vector $\\mathbf{p}$ (which contains properties of the dynamical model), the propagated state $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ will change. When changing the initial state by $\\Delta \\mathbf{x}_{0}$ and/or a parameter vector by $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}$, we will denote the resulting change in numerically propagated state, as a function of time, as $\\Delta {\\mathbf{x}}(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For given modifications $\\Delta \\mathbf{x}_{0}$ and $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}$, the behaviour of $\\Delta {\\mathbf{x}}(t)$ can be obtained by directly numerically repropagating $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ with the modified initial state and parameter vector, and subtracting the propagation result without these modifications. However, this can be a tedious and computationally expensive process. The matrices $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(t,t_{0})$ and $\\mathbf{S}(t)$ provide a way to approximate $\\Delta {\\mathbf{x}}(t)$, by means of a *linearization*:\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",

    "\n",
    "For this question, we split the total propagation time into 10 equisized (in time) arcs. Using the propagation settings of the previous question (case iii), the state and variational equations for the dynamics are propagated for each arc.  For each arc $i$ (with $i$ starting at 0), the initial state $\\mathbf{x}_{i}(t_{0,i})$ is set so that it corresponds exactly with the Lambert targeter state  at the corresponding time $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t_{0,i})$. This will result in a discontinuous state history over the full transfer (since the propagation is performed in an arc-wise manner). For this question, you will compute how to make the trajectory continuous in position by applying an impulsive correction maneuver at the start of each arc, such that $\\mathbf{r}_{i}=\\bar{\\mathbf{r}}_{i}$ at the end of each arc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer the following questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Perform the arcwise propagation. Plot the deviation $\\Delta r$ of the propagated state w.r.t. the Lambert arc as a function of time over the full trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Derive a model to use the results for $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{i}(t_{i+1},t_{i})$ to compute the change in velocity $\\Delta \\mathbf{v}_{i}$ needed at the beginning of each arc to ensure that the spacecraft reaches $\\bar{\\mathbf{r}}$ at the end of the arc. Keep the initial position of the arc constant. Show the derivation of your model. For this question, neglect linearization errors (assume $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\Delta{\\mathbf{x}}(t)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** Modify the code, so that the initial states of each arc are modified in accordance with your calculated correction manuevers in (b).  Plot the deviation $\\Delta r$ of the modified propagated state w.r.t. the Lambert arc as a function of time. Do you consider your linearized model to be applicable in this specific situation? \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- **d)** The model you derived in (b) will provide a trajectory that is continuous in position, but not velocity: there are velocity discontinuities between subsequent arcs. An impulsive $\\Delta V$ must be provided at each of these discontinuities, as well as at the initial time  the first arc, and final time of the last arc (to ensure $\\mathbf{x}=\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}$ at these points. Using the assumptions and derivation of (b), derive a set of equations that will provides the total $\\Delta {V}$, over the full trajectory, that are required. -->\n",

    "# Question 4\n",
    "## 25 points; Maximum text length:  lines\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, you will perform a similar analysis as in the previous question, but now using an approximate model for a low-thrust acceleration model to correct the orbit so that it reaches the start and end of the trajectory correctly. Instead of a ten-arc model, you will use a one- and two-arc model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your model, you will parameterize the thrust as a constant acceleration in RSW frame for each arc. This thrust will be added to the simulation by defining a so-called 'empirical' acceleration: a constant acceleration in RSW direction. Note that, since the direction of the RSW frame changes in time, the inertial direction of this empirical acceleration will change in time. For this question, you will compute the magnitudes of these emprical accelerations, such that the trajectory meets all the required boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calculating the sensitivity matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ for the entries of the empirical acceleration, you will be able to calculate (approximately) the required thust under a number of different conditions. For this question, neglect linearization errors (assume $\\Delta \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\Delta{\\mathbf{x}}(t)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer the following questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Consider a single arc propagation for the full transfer. Derive an equation to use the results for $\\mathbf{S}(t_{E})$ to compute the low-thrust acceleration in RSW frame (denote this as $\\mathbf{p}$) needed to ensure that the spacecraft reaches $\\bar{\\mathbf{r}}(t_{E})$ at the end of the transfer. Keep the initial state of the arc constant at $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t_{0})$. Put no constraints on the final velocity. Show the derivation of your model, starting from the equations in the lecture videos. <br>\n",
    "**b)** Implement your model for question (a) in your code, and verify and argue that it works correctly (use the same value of $\\Delta t$ as in question 2, case iii). Plot any quantities you need to show the correct functioning of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next questions, you will analyze the low-thrust trajectory for a two-arc model (with each arc having equal duration). For this question, do not impose any *a priori* constraints on the absolute position or velocity at the arc splitting point (unlike in question 3, where this point was required to correspond to $\\bar{\\mathbf{r}}$, but do impose a constraint of continuity in position and velocity over the full trajectory (unlike in question 3, where the velocity was discontinuous between arcs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** For an arbitrary choice of constant RSW-thrust in arc 1 (denoted $\\mathbf{p}_{1}$), thrust in arc 2 (denoted $\\mathbf{p}_{2}$), and modification in initial velocity of arc 1 (denoted $\\mathbf{v}_{i}(t_{0,1})$), derive a single equation for the change in position at the end of arc 2 (denoted $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t_{E,2})$). Write a single explicit equation for $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t_{E,2})$, in the following notation:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t_{E,2})=\\mathbf{A}\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{p}_{1}\\\\ \\mathbf{p}_{2} \\\\ \\Delta\\mathbf{v}_{i}(t_{0,1}) \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "and provide an explicit formulation for the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. Use the notation from the lecture slides on *Reaching the objective - Arc-wise Low-thrust*.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**d)** The equation you derived in (c) does not have a unique solution. Choose $ \\Delta\\mathbf{v}_{i}(t_{0,1})=\\mathbf{0}$, and set $\\mathbf{p}_{1}$ equal to the value of $\\mathbf{p}$ you derived and computed in questions (a) and (b). Starting from the equation you derived in (c), formulate an explicit equation for $\\mathbf{p}_{2}$ needed to achieve a given $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t_{E,2})$.<br>\n",
    "**e)**  Implement the model you derived in question (d) in your code, such that you obtain $\\mathbf{r}(t_{E,2})=\\bar{\\mathbf{r}}(t_{E,2})$ (*e.g.* such that the trajectory terminates on the Lambert arc). Verify that the model works correctly: show that it meets all the required constraints.\n",

    "    <li> Any text (legend, axis labels etc.) should be sufficiently large so as to be legible when printed on A4 paper. </li>\n",
    "    <li>Each curve should be distinguishable in your plots. </li>\n",
    "    <li>Adjust the scale (e.g. linear vs. logarithmic) of your plots as needed to interpret your data.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Make efficient use of space for graphs and plots. Whenever possible and legible: plot multiple curves (e.g. for different runs and/or elements) in a single figure. </li>\n",
